#NOTE: Alternative method of updating upvotes:
#1) in model: 
  #def add_upvote
     #current_votes = self.upvotes.to_i
     #total_with_additional_vote = (current_votes + 1)
     #self.update({:upvotes => total_with_additional_vote })
  #end

#2) in index view:
	#<%= link_to "â†‘", link_path(link), :method => :patch %>

#3) in link controller:
  #def update 
    #@link = Link.find(params[:id])
    #@link.add_upvote
    #redirect_to root_path
  #end
